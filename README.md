Version 1.0

I haven't found any Blender rig for UE5 Manny Skeleton, so I decided to make it myself. It's very basic at that moment but can be useful.
Features:
- Mirrorable poses
- Simple Feet IK (with Pole Target) and Hands IK
- Aim point (Rotates head toward it)

To implement:
- Better Feet Rig
- Fingers Rig
- Any other ideas

Use that rig for free, you can do any suggestions, pull requests and contribute to improving the rig, Epic Games owns the model.
