Version 1.0.1

I haven't found any Blender rig for UE5 Manny Skeleton, so I decided to make it myself. It's very basic at that moment but can be useful.
Features:

- Mirrorable poses
- Good Feet IK (with Pole Target) and Hands IK
- Aim point (Rotates head toward it)
- Fingers Rig

To implement:
- Any suggestions

Use that rig for free, you can do any suggestions, pull requests and contribute to improving the rig, Epic Games owns the model.
